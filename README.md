## What Is This Thing?

VLC Discord Rich Presence is a magical little bridge between your VLC Media Player and Discord, letting your friends see what media you're currently enjoying (or enduring). It shows:

- What you're watching/listening to
- Artist and album info (for music)
- Play/pause status
- Album/media artwork
- Fancy icons and progress bars

Built initially during a questionable 10-hour coding marathon and now significantly improved with proper architecture and Windows-optimized performance!

## Installation

### Windows Installation

1. Download the latest installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/valentin-marquez/vlc-discord-rp/releases)

   - **Installer**: `vlc-rpc-4.0.0-setup.exe` (Recommended)
   - **Portable**: `vlc-rpc-4.0.0-portable.exe` (No installation required)

2. Run the installer as Administrator (for best compatibility)
3. Follow the on-screen setup wizard
4. Launch VLC Discord RP from the Start Menu or Desktop shortcut
5. Enjoy your new Discord flex powers!

### Development Setup (Windows)

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm run dev`
4. Build for production: `npm run build:win`

### Legacy Platform Support

**macOS and Linux**: Version 3.x.x was the last release supporting these platforms. See our [Platform Migration Guide](docs/PLATFORM_MIGRATION.md) for alternatives and community solutions.

## How It Works

1. The application connects to VLC's Web Interface (automatically enabled if needed)
2. Media information is retrieved via HTTP requests to `http://localhost:{port}/requests/status.json`
3. Advanced content detection identifies what you're watching
4. Album artwork and media metadata are extracted and formatted
5. This information is relayed to Discord's Rich Presence API
6. Social validation achieved! üéâ

## FAQ

### Q: Why isn't anything showing up in Discord?

**A:** Make sure:

1. Both VLC and Discord are running
2. VLC's Web Interface is enabled (the app should enable this automatically)
3. You're playing a media file
4. Check the app for status information
5. If issues persist, try the reconnect button in settings

### Q: How do I close/exit the app?

**A:** Right-click the app icon in your system tray (Windows/Linux) or menu bar (macOS) and select "Exit". Or use the close button in the main window.

### Q: Where is it installed?

**A:** Default installation locations:

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\VLC Discord RP`
- macOS: `/Applications/VLC Discord RP.app`
- Linux: `/opt/vlc-discord-rp` or `/usr/bin/vlc-discord-rp`

### Q: Does it work on Mac/Linux?

**A:** Yes! Version 3.0 fully supports Windows, macOS, and Linux with native installers for each platform.

### Q: How much of my privacy am I giving up?

**A:** Only the title, artist, album info, and cover art from your media files are shared - and only with your Discord friends. We don't collect any data. Also, you can pause the sharing via the tray/menu bar icon.

### Q: I found a bug!

**A:** That's not a question, but I respect your enthusiasm. Please open an issue on GitHub with details about what went wrong.

### Q: Will this get me banned from Discord?

**A:** No! This app uses Discord's official Rich Presence API which is designed exactly for this purpose.

### Q: Why did you make this?

**A:** The voices told me to. Also, it seemed like a fun project.
